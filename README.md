# The-A-Team-Project2

### Team: Alejandro Barnatan, Aaron Garber-Paul, Brett Williams, Sung Choo, Adam Fancher

### Business question: 
Describe the data analyst/scientist job market in the United States, what insights can be gleaned in terms of availability, job rating, and salary? Where is the best place to be a data analyst? 

### Synopsis:
As expected, job availibilty was concentrated around big metro areas. The west coast, the northeast, and even big southern metro areas like Tampa, Austin, and Atlanta offered good availibitly. 

Upon further inspection, we found higher salaries to be offered in California by an overwhelming amount. The top 4 cities with the highest average mid point salary were all either in San Fransico or Los Angeles. 

Surprisingly, the places with the best company ratings where mostly in the southeast or midwest, with the exception of three cities in Maryland. This led us to beleive that while compensation was lower in these areas, people felt more content with their jobs.  

To find the city with the best overall value, we took the three categories which we used to measure the job market, and gave them weighted values. We felt salary was the most important factor, so we gave it a weight of 50%. Job rating seemed to be a more subjective factor, so we gave it a weight of 15%. We felt that job availibilty was the second most important factor so we wieghted it at 35%. 

After weighting each city's average salary, average job rating, and average amount of jobs, we found that Memphis ranked the heighest of all. Here we found that while Memphis didn't have an overwhelming amount of jobs, they still had decent availibilty. This coupled with the fact that Data Analysts are paid handsomly and people rated their jobs very highly means that Memphis has the best rounded package.
